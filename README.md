The questions are organized into modules based on Python topics:
- **Module 1** – Basics (input/output, variables, data types)
- **Module 2 – If-Else** – Conditional statements
- **Module 2 – Looping** – `for` loops, `while` loops
- **Additional Modules** – As the repository grows

Each module contains Python programs focused on that topic.
